M9 Simulations
=======
#### Background
With funding support from the National Science Foundation, a United States Geological Survey and University of Washington team studied the impacts of large magnitude, megathrust earthquakes on the Cascadia subduction zone ([The M9 Project](https://hazards.uw.edu/geology/m9/)). The researchers used physics-based simulations to generate possible ground motions for the entire Pacific Northwest region during a magnitude-9 (M9) event. The simulations used a deterministic, finite difference approach for long periods (i.e., > 1 s) and a stochastic approach for short periods (i.e., < 1 s). The finite difference portion of the simulations used a [3-D seismic velocity model](https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/ofr20171152) for the Cascadia subduction zone, which includes realistic subduction geometry and several sedimentary basins. Ground motions were generated for thirty possible earthquake rupture scenarios of a magnitude-9 CSZ earthquake. More information on the simulations can be found in the following reference:

An additional 20 simulations were conducted to evaluate the sensitivities of the computed ground motions to model assumptions.

These simulated motions have been used to estimate the vulnerability of idealized structural systems and reinforced-concrete core-wall building to M9 motions.
