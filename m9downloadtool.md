M9 Download Tool
=======

The M9 simulations download tool is a web service that enables users to download simulated broadband ground motions, response spectra, and metadata at locations throughout the Pacific Northwest for multiple realizations of a magnitude-9 earthquake due to a full rupture of the Cascadia subduction zone.

The site locations available for download are documented here.  Broadband ground motions can be downloaded for a particular site name or the closest site to a particular latitude and longitude. The output can be provided in either JSON or CSV formats:

-[Downloads by Site Coordinates (in JSON format)](/service1)

-[Downloads by Site Name (in JSON format)](/service2)

-[Downloads by Site Coordinates (in CSV format)](/service3)

-[Downloads by Site Name (in CSV format)](/service4)

#### Acknowledgments
The simulations were the result of a collaboration between researchers at the University of Washington and United States Geological Survey (USGS) with the financial support from the National Science Foundation ([Award Number 1331412](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1331412)).
